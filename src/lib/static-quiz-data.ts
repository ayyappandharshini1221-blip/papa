          "explanation": "`print()` and `str()` use `__str__`. The interactive console and `repr()` use `__repr__`. If `__str__` is not defined, `__repr__` is used as a fallback."

            "A way to manage global variables.",

          "explanation": "The `with` statement ensures that cleanup code in the `__exit__` method is always executed, even if errors occur within the block. This is a robust way to handle resource setup and teardown."

            "Classes that are more important than others.",

          "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "Metaclasses are an advanced concept that allows you to control how classes are created. The default metaclass is `type`. By creating your own metaclass, you can inject or modify behavior at the time of class creation, which is used in frameworks like Django and SQLAlchemy."

          "answers": [
            "Python does not support inheritance.",
            "A class can inherit from a single parent class only.",
            "A class can inherit attributes and methods from one or more parent classes.",

          ],
          "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
          "explanation": "Python supports multiple inheritance. When a method is called, Python uses the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine which parent class's method to use if there are conflicts."

          "answers": [
            "A style of programming where you must explicitly declare the type of every variable.",
            "A concept where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines.",
            "A naming convention for Python variables.",

          "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
          "explanation": "The saying is: 'If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.' In Python, this means you don't care about an object's specific type, only whether it has the methods or attributes you need to perform an operation."
